My decision to embrace a lifestyle that opts to not eat any products sourced from animals really came down to just five animals. Me, my wife, and my three kids. I made the decision, 100% based, on my overall health and my desire to live long enough to see all my children grow up to become productive human beings. The fact that it is saving animal lives is a secondary benefit.

## Definitions

### Vegan (/ˈvēɡən/)

veg·an: a person who does not eat any food derived from animals and who _typically_ does not use other animal products.

### Pescatarian (/ˌpeskəˈterēən/)

pes·ca·tar·i·an: a person who does not eat meat but does eat fish

## What I am not

### I am not a _strict_ vegan.

In what ways do I stray from the strict path?

- 〰️ I wear leather shoes & have leather car seats
- 〰️ I cook meat for my kids and give them milk

I simply choose not to eat meat or dairy and try like heck to avoid all other foods derived from animals. Yes this includes honey for the 🐝 's sake. I read labels religiously and do my best to eat food with as few ingredients as possible, ingredients I can pronounce, and I trust the &#9419; stamp on packaging.

I would say I am more like a pescatarian that doesn't eat fish. What's the difference? I like nice shoes and you'll never catch me in Birkenstocks.

### I am not a sounding board for 1,000,000 reason why I should be a strict vegan either.

I respect your thoughts and opinions - and your right to have them - but like my man popeye said 'I 🍠 what I 🍠'

Also, I don't eat yams.

### I am not a doctor, dietitians, or nutritionists.

Nothing you read here should be considered advice on how to live. I am more than happy to share my experiences, thoughts, and feelings on this topic - but I am not, in any way, qualified to tell you how to live your life.
