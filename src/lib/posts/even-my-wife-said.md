I tried Trader Joes Meatless Ground and it was, in a ~~word~~ hyphenated-word, super-amazing!

## The TLDR

It's good. So good!

## The Upside

- The texture is very close to actual ground beef. My wife (_not a vegan at all_) tried it and commented on how close the texture was to actual beef.
- Like beef, the flavor pallet options are bountiful. I used a Trader Joes Taco Seasoning for this go 'round - but set some aside and tried it with just salt and pepper and it was great. I believe this could be used in most any recipe in place of beef.
- Much like the other plant based meat replacements I have experienced - one overwhelming difference between this and beef is the lack of grease.
  - Not putting that grease into my body has had numerous benefits thus far (see my post on <a href="/blog/my-poop-post">poops</a>).
  - Kitchen clean up and dishes is far easier. Without all that grease splatter I am saving money on Dawn dish soap!
- [Cooking](#cooking) this product is a joyful breeze!

## The Downside

- Well..... lemme think....
  - This is a personal one - but Trader Joe's is a good 30-45 min drive, each way, but you can order it online so ...
  - It is about $4.00 for what equates to one pound of quality ground meat ... less than or the same as what Google just told me beef costs as of this writing ...
  - Oh! I know! You can not stock your freezer with it to eat in the event of a Zombie Apocalypse; but that is because it is "dried, textured pea protein" and can be stored at room temperature according to Trader Joe's website ...
- TODO: Find a downside to appear objective even if there is not one simply to avoid appearing biased.
