I found myself wondering why do we (mainly I) apologize for something, and moreover why _should_ we apologize for something.

## The Impetus

The other morning on the way to work I accidentally cut someone off as I pulled onto a road. As I was clearly being negligent in my driving, and knowing how infuriating something like that can be - when we came to a stop sign a couple of hundred yards up I popped out to quickly apologize.

I quickly opened my door and looked back at the driver behind me. I then made the universal "my bad" signal by tapping my chest and said "_I am so sorry_". I even managed to have a friendly smile on my face.

The guy was not happy! He gave me a mean look and pointed forward towards my vehicle to say "get back in your vehicle and get out of my way!". I got back in my vehicle, feeling slighting humiliated and drove off - probably a bit faster than I would have normally. As I drove I thought about what a jerk that guy was! How dare he not immediately accept my apology? Then I started thinking ...

## The Question

**_Why_ was I angry?**

At the core of it - I was angry because the other persons response did not meet with _my_ preset expectation of what it should have been. How dare that guy not just absolve me of my guilt, tell me what a good person I am, and allow me to drive off feeling great about myself?? ðŸ˜¡

Let's break this sequence of events down here shall we?

<ol>
<li><b><mark>I<mark></b> pull into the roadway and cut someone off </li>
<li><b><mark>I<mark></b> then delay their travels so that <b><mark>I<mark></b> can apologize and <b><mark>I<mark></b> can feel better</li>
<li><b><mark>I<mark></b> get angry when the response isn't what <b><mark>I<mark></b> expected </li>
</ol>

<p><b><mark>I<mark></b> and starting to think <b><mark>I<mark></b> am the cause of my anger here....</p>

I was angry when his response didn't meet with _my_ expectations.... how was he supposed to know what I expected?

After coming to this conclusion I felt .... well I felt silly to be honest. But then I asked _"Why do I apologize?"_ Do I apologize to help alleviate some level of pain (or annoyance in the case) I have caused someone else? Or do I apologize to make myself feel better? I think I know what the answer should be; but I think I also know what the answer is in many cases.

**Does the intent matter**

I think it clearly does. In this case I allowed anger into my day 100% because of a situation I caused and then I reacted too.

## The Answer

I was angry because, in essence, I didn't get what I wanted. I was angry because of my emotional immaturity.

**_So what's the fix?_**

I don't have a fix ... I can, and will, try to be more mindful of _why_ I feel the way I do, and try to be cognizant of the cause of those feelings (and when how much of that cause is me). That is about all I can do for now.
