  return `<p>My decision to embrace a lifestyle that opts to not eat any products sourced from animals really came down to just five animals. Me, my wife, and my three kids. I made the decision, 100% based, on my overall health and my desire to live long enough to see all my children grow up to become productive human beings. The fact that it is saving animal lives is a secondary benefit.</p>

<h3 id="vegan-ˈvēɡən"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#vegan-ˈvēɡən"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Vegan (/ˈvēɡən/)</h3>
<p>veg·an: a person who does not eat any food derived from animals and who <em>typically</em> does not use other animal products.</p>
<h3 id="pescatarian-ˌpeskəˈterēən"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#pescatarian-ˌpeskəˈterēən"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Pescatarian (/ˌpeskəˈterēən/)</h3>
<p>pes·ca·tar·i·an: a person who does not eat meat but does eat fish</p>

<h3 id="i-am-not-a-strict-vegan"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#i-am-not-a-strict-vegan"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>I am not a <em>strict</em> vegan.</h3>
<p>In what ways do I stray from the strict path?</p>
<ul><li>I wear leather shoes &amp; have leather car seats</li>
<li>I cook meat for my kids and give them milk</li></ul>
<p>I simply choose not to eat meat or dairy and try like heck to avoid all other foods derived from animals. Yes this includes honey for the 🐝 ‘s sake. I read labels religiously and do my best to eat food with as few ingredients as possible, ingredients I can pronounce, and I trust the Ⓥ stamp on packaging.</p>
<p>I would say I am more like a pescatarian that doesn’t eat fish. What’s the difference? I like nice shoes and you’ll never catch me in Birkenstocks.</p>

<p>I respect your thoughts and opinions - and your right to have them - but like my man popeye said ‘I 🍠 what I 🍠’</p>
<p>Also, I don’t eat yams.</p>
