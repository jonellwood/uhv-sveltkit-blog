<h2 id="the-impetus"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-impetus"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Impetus</h2>
<p>The other morning on the way to work I accidentally cut someone off as I pulled onto a road. As I was clearly being negligent in my driving, and knowing how infuriating something like that can be - when we came to a stop sign a couple of hundred yards up I popped out to quickly apologize.</p>
<p>I quickly opened my door and looked back at the driver behind me. I then made the universal ‚Äúmy bad‚Äù signal by tapping my chest and said ‚Äù<em>I am so sorry</em>‚Äù. I even managed to have a friendly smile on my face.</p>

<p>The guy was not happy! He gave me a mean look and pointed forward towards my vehicle to say ‚Äúget back in your vehicle and get out of my way!‚Äú. I got back in my vehicle, feeling slighting humiliated and drove off - probably a bit faster than I would have normally. As I drove I thought about what a jerk that guy was! How dare he not immediately accept my apology? Then I started thinking ‚Ä¶</p>
<h2 id="the-question"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-question"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Question</h2>
<p><strong><em>Why</em> was I angry?</strong></p>
<p>At the core of it - I was angry because the other persons response did not meet with <em>my</em> preset expectation of what it should have been. How dare that guy not just absolve me of my guilt, tell me what a good person I am, and allow me to drive off feeling great about myself?? üò°</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs break this sequence of events down here shall we?</p>
<ol><li><b><mark>I<mark></mark></mark></b> pull into the roadway and cut someone off </li>
<li><b><mark>I<mark></mark></mark></b> then delay their travels so that <b><mark>I<mark></mark></mark></b> can apologize and <b><mark>I<mark></mark></mark></b> can feel better</li>
<li><b><mark>I<mark></mark></mark></b> get angry when the response isn&#39;t what <b><mark>I<mark></mark></mark></b> expected </li></ol>
<p><b><mark>I<mark></mark></mark></b> and starting to think <b><mark>I<mark></mark></mark></b> am the cause of my anger here....</p>
<p>I was angry when his response didn‚Äôt meet with <em>my</em> expectations‚Ä¶ how was he supposed to know what I expected?</p>
<p>After coming to this conclusion I felt ‚Ä¶ well I felt silly to be honest. But then I asked <em>‚ÄúWhy do I apologize?‚Äù</em> Do I apologize to help alleviate some level of pain (or annoyance in the case) I have caused someone else? Or do I apologize to make myself feel better? I think I know what the answer should be; but I think I also know what the answer is in many cases.</p>
<p><strong>Does the intent matter</strong></p>
<p>I think it clearly does. In this case I allowed anger into my day 100% because of a situation I caused and then I reacted too.</p>
<h2 id="the-answer"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-answer"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Answer</h2>
<p>I was angry because, in essence, I didn‚Äôt get what I wanted. I was angry because of my emotional immaturity.</p>
<p><strong><em>So what‚Äôs the fix?</em></strong></p>
<p>I don‚Äôt have a fix ‚Ä¶ I can, and will, try to be more mindful of <em>why</em> I feel the way I do, and try to be cognizant of the cause of those feelings (and when how much of that cause is me). That is about all I can do for now.</p>`;
