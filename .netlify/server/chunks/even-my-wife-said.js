<h2 id="the-tldr"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-tldr"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The TLDR</h2>
<p>It’s good. So good!</p>
<h2 id="the-upside"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-upside"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Upside</h2>
<ul><li>The texture is very close to actual ground beef. My wife (<em>not a vegan at all</em>) tried it and commented on how close the texture was to actual beef.</li>
<li>Like beef, the flavor pallet options are bountiful. I used a Trader Joes Taco Seasoning for this go ‘round - but set some aside and tried it with just salt and pepper and it was great. I believe this could be used in most any recipe in place of beef.</li>
<li>Much like the other plant based meat replacements I have experienced - one overwhelming difference between this and beef is the lack of grease.<ul><li>Not putting that grease into my body has had numerous benefits thus far (see my post on <a href="/blog/my-poop-post">poops</a>).</li>
<li>Kitchen clean up and dishes is far easier. Without all that grease splatter I am saving money on Dawn dish soap!</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="#cooking">Cooking</a> this product is a joyful breeze!</li></ul>
<h2 id="the-downside"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-downside"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Downside</h2>
<ul><li>Well… lemme think…<ul><li>This is a personal one - but Trader Joe’s is a good 30-45 min drive, each way, but you can order it online so …</li>
<li>It is about $4.00 for what equates to one pound of quality ground meat … less than or the same as what Google just told me beef costs as of this writing …</li>
<li>Oh! I know! You can not stock your freezer with it to eat in the event of a Zombie Apocalypse; but that is because it is “dried, textured pea protein” and can be stored at room temperature according to Trader Joe’s website …</li></ul></li>
<li>TODO: Find a downside to appear objective even if there is not one simply to avoid appearing biased.</li></ul>
